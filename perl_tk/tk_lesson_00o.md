## Why learn Tk

Perl and Tk are both old technologies; some might even say they are both legacy technologies. 
You might reasonably ask yourself if your time would be better spent learning web technologies

Here are some of my reasons for learning and writing about Perl Tk:

- I use Perl scripts quite a lot for my own data munging
- Perl Tk offers me a relatively simple way to create convenient GUIs for such scripts
- I frequently use Perl to wrap or augment shell scripts so I can employ Perl Tk to manage these too
- Writing Perl Tk code has made me a better programmer
- If you know PerlTk, writing Python Tkinter is very easy
- Perl Tk can be used for prototyping for applications that can then be written as web apps
