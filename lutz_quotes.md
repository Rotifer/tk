Although simple in this trivial example, arguments are generally preferred to globals, because they make external dependencies more explicit, and so make code easier to understand and change. In fact, the same handler might be usable in other contexts, if we don’t couple it to global variables’ values. While you’ll have to take it on faith until we step up to larger examples with more complex state retention needs, avoiding globals in callbacks and GUIs in general both makes them more reusable, and supports the notion of multiple instances in the same program. It’s good programming practice, GUI or not.
